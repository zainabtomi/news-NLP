
Webpack Project with Service Worker..

This project focuses on developing a web tool that enables users to perform Natural Language Processing (NLP) on articles or blog posts from various websites. When a user submits the URL of an article, the web page retrieves and displays sentiment analysis results generated by the MeaningCloud API, based on the article's content.


Technologies : 
  -Webpack
  -SCSS

## Note ##
I had difficulty activating my MeaningCloud account and getting the issue with obtaining an API key and I did not receive a response so I used the API key from a colleague. I hope this will be taken into consideration.
